## Description

A PDU (Power Distribution Unit) is a device fitted with multiple outputs designed to distribute electric power, especially to racks of computers and networking equipment located within a data center.  The PDU Mass Commissioning tool that we are designing will allow users to create configuration files and networking capabilities for PDUs in a system.  The app will allow for the necessary configuration parameters needed for operation within the system.  Once all of the configuration parameters have been set within the app, users will be able to "export" the files to a USB drive, which will be plugged into the PDUs to be commissioned.

The PDU Mass Commissioning tool will be a simple user interface that allows customers to create all of the necessary configuration files to configure all of their PDUs. The app will have a variable number of input fields for all the configuration parameters in which users will enter their desired configurations. Once they have entered all of the configuration parameters they will click "export" and the application will build the configuration file hierarchy into a chosen USB drive.
